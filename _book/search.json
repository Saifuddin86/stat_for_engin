This aspect of statistics is called descriptive statistics. Usually, data are summarized both numerically and graphically.  In this module, our focus will be concentrated on the following topics:\n(i) Numerical Summaries of Data (ii) Graphical summaries (Histogram and  Box Plot)\nNumerical summaries of the data\nOften to summarize data we use some numerical measures like measures of central tendency, measures of location and measures of variation. The common numerical summaries are:\nWhile studying these numerical summaries, we consider sample data.",

    "text": "1.2 Measures of central tendency and quantile\n\n1.2.1 Mean\n\nSample mean: Suppose \\(n\\) observation of a variable \\(X\\) is drawn from a population. Then the sample mean is denoted by \\(\\bar x\\) and\n\\[\n\\bar x =\\frac{\\sum x}{n}\n\\]\nThe sample mean \\(\\bar x\\) is a sample statistic.\nPopulation mean: Suppose in a population there are \\(N\\) values of variable \\(X\\). Then the population mean is denoted by \\(\\mu\\) and\n\\[\n\\mu =\\frac{\\sum x}{N}\n\\]\nThe \\(\\bar x\\) is a point estimator of the population mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\nExample 1.1: Eight prototype units are produced and their pull-off forces measured, resulting in the following data (in pounds): 12 .6, 12. 9, 13. 4, 12. 3, 13. 6, 13 .5, 12. 6, 13. 1.\nSuppose,\\(X=\\)pull-off forces (in pounds). So,\n\\(X=\\{x_1,x_2,...,x_8\\}=\\{12.6,12.9,…,13.1\\}\\)\nThe sample mean is, pounds\n\\[\n\\bar x=\\frac{\\sum x}{n}=\\frac{12.6+12.9+...+13.1}{8}=\\frac{104}{8}=13.0 \\ \\ pounds\n\\]\n\n\n1.2.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of central location. The median is the value in the middle when the data are arranged in ascending order (smallest value to largest value).\n\nFor an odd number of observations, median is the middle value\nFor an even number of observations, median is the average of the two middle values\n\nExample 1.2: CPU time of 9 jobs (in seconds):\nData: 59, 139, 46, 37, 42, 30, 55, 56, 82\nArranged/sorted data: 30, 37, 42, 46, 55, 56, 59, 82, 139\nMedian=55; whereas the Mean=60.67\nExample 1.3 : CPU time of 10 jobs (in seconds): 59, 139, 46, 37, 42, 30, 55, 56, 36, 82\nArranged/sorted data: 30, 36, 37, 42, 46, 55, 56, 59, 82, 139.\nMedian = (46+55)/2=50.5; whereas Mean=58.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that the median is unaffected by the size of the largest CPU time. It impiles that, mean is affected by extreme value or outlier but median is not.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Mode\nis the most frequently occurring data value.\n\n\n1.2.4 Percentiles\nPercentiles divide the whole data set into approximately 100 equal parts. So, there are 99 percentiles -\\(P_1, P_2,...,P_{99}\\). In this lecture \\(j^{th}\\) percentile will be denoted by \\(P_j\\) .\nWe can compute the \\(j^{th}\\) percentile as follows:\n\\[\nP_j=(j*\\frac{n+1}{100})^{th} \\ \\ value; \\ \\ j=1,2,...,99.\n\\]\nExample 1.4: Compute the 25th and 60th percentile from the following data:\nCPU time of 9 jobs (in seconds): 59, 46, 37, 42, 30, 55, 56, 36, and 82.\nSolution: Here, \\(n=9\\).\nSorted data:  30, 36, 37, 42, 46, 55, 56, 59, and 82.\nSo, \\(P_{25}=(25*\\frac{9+1}{100})^{th} \\ \\ value=2.5^{th} \\ \\ value\\)\n\\(=2^{nd} \\ \\ value +0.5(3^{rd}-2^{nd})=36+0.5(37-36)=36.5\\).\nInterpretation: \\(P_{25}=36.5\\) implies that approximately 25% of the total observations lie below or equal to 36.5.\nSimilarly, \\(P_{60}=(60*\\frac{9+1}{100})^{th}\\ \\ value=6^{th}\\ \\ value=55\\).\nInterpretation: \\(P_{60}=55\\) implies that approximately 60% of the total observations lie below or equal to 55.\n\n\n1.2.5 Quartiles\nIt is often desirable to divide data into four parts, with each part containing approximately one-fourth, or 25% of the observations. The division points are referred to as the quartiles and are defined as\nQ1 = first quartile, or 25th percentile\nQ2 = second quartile, or 50th percentile (also the median)\nQ3 = third quartile, or 75th percentile.\nExample 1.5: Here is the monthly starting salary ($) of 12 graduates:\n3450, 3550, 3650, 3480, 3355, 3310, 3490, 3730, 3540, 3925, 3520, 3480\nCompute Q1 and Q3 of the above data (Will be solved in class).",

    "section": "1.3 Measures of variability",
    "text": "1.3 Measures of variability\nVariability in data means lack of uniformity. It is also referred to as spread, scatter, or dispersion. We turn now to a discussion of some commonly used measures of variability.\n\n1.3.1 Range\n\\[\nRange=Largest \\ \\ value-Smallest \\ \\ value\n\\]\n\nHeavily influenced by extreme values\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Inter-quartile-range (IQR)\n\\[\nIQR=Q_3-Q_1\n\\]\n\nIt exhibits the variability in the middle 50% of the observations.\nThe interquartile range is less sensitive to the extreme values in the sample than is the ordinary sample range.\n\nDetection of outliers using 1.5(IQR) rule\nIn this method, we discuss fences.\n\nThe lower fence of distribution is 𝒍𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓 𝒇𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆, \\(lf=Q_1-1.5(IQR)\\)\nThe upper fence of distribution is 𝒖𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒓 𝒇𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆, \\(uf=Q_3+1.5(IQR)\\)\nIf any value lies outside the interval \\([lf,uf]\\); then it will be considered an outlier.\n\nExample 1.6: The following data set represents the number of new computer accounts registered during ten consecutive days.  43, 37, 50, 51, 58, 105, 52, 45, 45, 10. Check for outliers using the 1.5(IQR) rule.\n\n\n1.3.3 Variance and standard deviation\nThe variability or scatter in the data around mean may be described by the variance and standard deviation.\n\nPopulation variance: If \\(x_1, x_2, ...,x_N\\) is a population of \\(N\\) observations , the population variance is\n\\[\n\\sigma^2=\\frac{(x_1-\\mu)^2+(x_2-\\mu)^2+...+(x_N-\\mu)^2}{N}\n\\]\n\\[\n=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\mu)^2} {N}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2}{N}-\\mu^2\n\\]\nSample variance: If \\(x_1, x_2, ...,x_n\\) is a sample of \\(n\\) observations , the sample variance is\n\n\\[\ns^2=\\frac{(x_1-\\bar x)^2+(x_2-\\bar x)^2+...+(x_n-\\bar x)^2}{n-1}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar x)^2} {n-1}\n\\]\n\nAn alternative formula for the computation of the sample variance is:\n\n\\[\ns^2=\\frac{\\sum x_i^2-n\\bar x^2}{n-1}\n\\] where, \\(\\sum x_i^2=x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2\\)\nExample 1.7: Eight prototype units are produced and their pull-off forces measured, resulting in the following data (in pounds): 12 .6, 12. 9, 13. 4, 12. 3, 13. 6, 13 .5, 12. 6, 13. Compute sample variance.\nSolution:\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Computation of the sample variance for the pull-off force data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull-off force(\\(x_i\\))\nSample mean, \\(\\bar x\\)\n\\((x_i-\\bar x)\\)\n\\((x_i-\\bar x)^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n12.6\n13\n-0.4\n0.16\n\n\n12.9\n13\n-0.1\n0.01\n\n\n13.4\n13\n0.4\n0.16\n\n\n12.3\n13\n-0.7\n0.49\n\n\n13.6\n13\n0.6\n0.36\n\n\n13.5\n13\n0.5\n0.25\n\n\n12.6\n13\n-0.4\n0.16\n\n\n13.1\n13\n0.1\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sum (x_i-\\bar x ) =0\\)\n\\(\\sum (x_i-\\bar x )^2 =1.6\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\ns^2=\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2}{n-1}=\\frac{1.6}{8-1}=0.2286 \\ \\ (pounds)^2\n\\]\nAlternative: Here \\(\\sum x^2 =12.6^2+12.9^2+\\cdot \\cdot\\cdot+13.1^2=1353.6\\)\n\\(\\bar x=13\\)\nSo, \\(s^2=\\frac{\\sum x^2-n\\times \\bar x^2}{n-1}=\\frac{1353.6-8\\times (13^2)}{8-1}=0.2285714\\approx 0.2286 \\ \\ (pounds)^2\\)\nStandard deviation\nThe standard deviation is defined to be the positive square root of the variance\n\nSample standard deviation=\\(s=\\sqrt {s^2}\\)\nPopulation standard deviation=\\(\\sigma =\\sqrt {\\sigma ^2}\\)\n\n\nThe sample standard deviation \\(s\\) is the estimator of population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nExample 1.8: The standard deviation of the previous example is :\n\\[ s=\\sqrt {0.2286} \\approx0.48 \\ \\ pounds\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation is easier to interpret than the variance because the standard deviation is measured in the same units as the data.\n\n\nFor example, the sample variance for the pull-off force data of prototype units is \\(s^2=0.2286 \\ \\ (pounds)^2\\).\nBecause the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, the units of the variance, pounds squared, are converted to pound in the standard deviation.\nThus, the standard deviation of the pull-off force data is 0.48 pounds. In other words, the standard deviation is measured in the same units as the original data. For this reason the standard deviation is more easily compared to the mean and other statistics that are measured in the same units as the original data.\n\n\n1.3.4 Coefficient of variation\nIn some situations we may be interested in a descriptive statistic that indicates how large the standard deviation is relative to the mean. This measure is called the coefficient of variation and is usually expressed as a percentage.\nCoefficient variation,\n\\[CV=\\frac{Standard \\ \\ deviation}{Mean}\\]\n\nThe coefficient of variation is a relative measure of variability; it measures the standard deviation relative to the mean.\nIn general, the coefficient of variation is a useful statistic for comparing the variability of variables that have different standard deviations and different means.\n\nExample 1.9: The table at the left shows the population heights (in inches) and weights (in pounds) of the members of a basketball team. Find the coefficient of variation for the heights and the weights. Then compare the results.\n\nDataCoefficient of variation\n\n\n\n\n\nHeights (inches)\nWeights (pounds)\n\n\n\n\n72\n180\n\n\n74\n168\n\n\n68\n225\n\n\n76\n201\n\n\n74\n189\n\n\n69\n192\n\n\n72\n197\n\n\n79\n162\n\n\n70\n174\n\n\n69\n171\n\n\n77\n185\n\n\n73\n210\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean height \\(\\mu \\approx 72.8 \\ \\ inches\\) with a standard deviation \\(\\sigma =3.3 \\ \\ inches\\).\nThe coefficient of variation for the heights is\n\n\\(CV_{height}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}.100\\%=\\frac{3.3}{72.8} . 100\\% \\approx 4.5\\%\\).\nThe mean weight \\(\\mu \\approx 187.8 \\ \\ pounds\\) with a standard deviation \\(\\sigma =17.7 \\ \\ pounds\\).\nThe coefficient of variation for the weights is\n\\(CV_{weight}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}.100\\%=\\frac{17.7}{187.8}.100\\% \\approx9.4\\%\\)\nInterpretation The weights (9.4%) are more variable than the heights (4.5%).",

    "text": "1.4 Graphical summary/visualization\nBefore diving into advanced analysis we should have a look at the data. Because ” A picture is worth a thousand words”. Often a summary of a collection of data via a graphical display can provide insight regarding the system from which the data were taken.\n\n1.4.1 Frequency Distributions and Histograms\nTo construct a frequency distribution, we must divide the range of the data into intervals, which are usually called class intervals, cells, or bins, and count how many observations fall into each bin.\nThe histogram is a visual display of the frequency distribution.\n\nA frequency histogram consists of columns, one for each bin, whose height is determined by the number of observations in the bin. [Frequency distribution]\nA relative frequency histogram has the same shape but a different vertical scale. Its column heights represent the proportion of all data that appeared in each bin. [Relative frequency distribution]\n\nWhat is the appropriate size of bins?\nThere are several rules, but one of them is, the number of bins, suppose \\(k=\\sqrt n\\). We will discuss how to construct a frequency distribution, relative frequency distribution, and cumulative frequency distribution in the following example.\nExample 1.10: The following data are the joint temperatures of the O-rings (°F) for each test firing or actual launch of the space shuttle rocket motor (from Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Vol. 1, pp. 129–131):\n\n67, 40, 58, 76, 58, 70, 72, 67, 75, 70, 57, 83, 53, 45, 70, 81, 78, 76, 67, 73, 61, 52, 31, 67, 79, 75, 69, 84, 68, 80\n\nTo construct frequency distribution and others follow the steps:\nStep-1: Find the number bins, \\(k=\\sqrt n=\\sqrt 30=5.48\\approx 6\\) (round to nearest integer).\nStep-2: Find the range of the data, \\(R=Maximum-Minimum=84-31=53\\)\nStep-3: Determine bin width, \\(w=\\frac{R}{k}=\\frac{53}{6}=8.83 \\approx 10\\)\nStep-4: Define the bins in exclusive method, starting from a suitable data value close to lowest value, for example [30, 40), [40, 50), and so on until we have the highest data value.\nStep-5: Now count the observation fall in each bin, using tally.\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Frequency, Relative frequency, Cumulative frequency Distribution for the O-rings temperature data (n=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures\n(in o F)\nTally\nFrequency (f)\nRelative frequency (rf)\nCumulative frequency (cf)\n\n\n\n\n[30,40)\n|\n1\n0.03\n1\n\n\n[40,50)\n||\n2\n0.07\n3\n\n\n[50,60)\n||||\n5\n0.17\n8\n\n\n[60,70)\n|||| ||\n7\n0.23\n15\n\n\n[70,80)\n|||| |||| |\n11\n0.37\n26\n\n\n[80,90)\n||||\n4\n0.13\n30\n\n\nTotal\n\nn=30\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Histogram\nThe histogram provides a visual impression of the shape of the distribution of the measurements and information about the central tendency and scatter or dispersion in the data.\nThe histogram from the previous example is shown in Figure 1.1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Frequency histogram of temperature (°F)\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram and shape of the distribution\nWhen the sample size is large, the histogram can provide a reasonably reliable indicator of the general shape of the distribution or population of measurements from which the sample was drawn. (for detail see Montgomery and Runger (2014) ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Histograms for symmetric and skewed distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Box-plot\nThe box plot is a graphical display that simultaneously describes several important features of a data set, such as center, spread, departure from symmetry, and identification of unusual observations or outliers.\nA box plot, sometimes called box-and-whisker plots, displays the three quartiles, the minimum/lower fence, and the maximum/upper fence of the data on a rectangular box, aligned either horizontally or vertically.\nIf any value falls outside the fences then it will shown as a circle in the box-plot.\nExample 1.11\n\nVariable-IVariable-II\n\n\nSuppose, X={10,15,14,18,17,12,16,15,19,21,32,12,58}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose, Y={5,8,14,15,18,17,16,14,15,21,21,35,17,16,20}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Boxplot and skewness of the data\nWhen we discuss the frequency histogram we also learned about shape of the distribution. By visual inspection of boxplot we can also tell about the distribution shape of a variable. The following boxplots are the typycal examples of skewness of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparative/Parallel box-plots\nBox plots are very useful in graphical comparisons among data sets because they have high visual impact and are easy to understand.\n\nFor instance, here the Life expectancy at birth (in year) of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan is compared using a comparative box-plot from 1971 to 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What is/are your observation(s) from this above comparative box-plot?",

On average, how many manufactured ball bearings will be scrapped?\nExample 6.10 : Gauges are used to reject all components for which a certain dimension is not within the specification \\(1.50 \\pm d\\). It is known that this measurement is normally distributed with a mean of 1.50 and a standard deviation of 0.2. Determine the value d such that the specifications “cover” 95% of the measurements.\nSolution:\nLet, \\(X=measurement \\ \\ of \\ \\ certain \\ \\ dimension\\)\nGiven, \\(X\\sim N(1.5,0.2)\\)\nAccording to question,\n\\(P(1.5-d&lt;X&lt;1.5+d)=0.95\\)\nSo, \\(P(X&lt;1.5-d)+P(X&gt;1.5+d)=0.05\\)\n\nSo, \\(P(X &lt;1.5-d)=0.025  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot(1)\\)\n\\(\\implies P(\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} &lt;\\frac{1.5-d-1.5}{0.2})=0.025\\)\n\\(\\implies P(Z&lt;\\frac{-d}{0.2})=0.025 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot(1)\\)\nFrom TABLE A.2 we have\n\\(P(Z&lt;-1.96)=0.025 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\cdot \\cdot\\cdot(2)\\)\nComparing eq.(1) with eq. (2) we have\n\\(\\frac{-d}{0.2}=-1.96\\)\n\\(\\implies -d=-0.392\\)\n\\(\\therefore d=0.392\\)\nAlternative:\n\\(P(X &lt;1.5-d)=0.025  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot(1)\\)\nBut, \\(P(Z&lt;-1.96)=0.025 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (2)\\)\nHence, \\(1.5-d=\\mu+z\\sigma\\); where \\(z=-1.96\\)\n\\(\\implies 1.5-d=1.5-1.96\\times 0.2\\)\n\\(\\therefore d=0.392\\)\nExercise 6.11 : A soft-drink machine is regulated so that it discharges an average of 200 milliliters per cup. If the amount of drink is normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to 15 milliliters,\n\nwhat fraction of the cups will contain more than 224 milliliters?\nwhat is the probability that a cup contains between 191 and 209 milliliters?\nhow many cups will probably overflow if 230-milliliter cups are used for the next 1000 drinks?\nbelow what value do we get the smallest 25% of the drinks?\n\nExercise 6.14 The finished inside diameter of a piston ring is normally distributed with a mean of 10 centimeters and a standard deviation of 0.03 centimeter.\n\nWhat proportion of rings will have inside diameters exceeding 10.075 centimeters?\nWhat is the probability that a piston ring will have an inside diameter between 9.97 and 10.03 centimeters?\nBelow what value of inside diameter will 15% of the piston rings fall?\n\nExercise 6.17 : The average life of a certain type of small motor is 10 years with a standard deviation of 2 years. The manufacturer replaces free all motors that fail while under guarantee. If she is willing to replace only 3% of the motors that fail, how long a guarantee should be offered? Assume that the lifetime of a motor follows a normal distribution.\n\n\n6.2.7 Normal approximation to Binomial distribution\nBinom tends to normal when \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and \\(p\\rightarrow 0.5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Histogram of \\(Bin(x; n=6,p=0.2)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Histogram of \\(Bin(x; n=15,p=0.2)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Histogram of \\(Bin(x; n=50,p=0.2)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 6.8, Figure 6.9 and Figure 6.10 we observe that as \\(n\\) getting large with \\(p=0.2\\) (which is not extremely close to 0) the binomial distribution can be approximated to normal distribution.\nSo, when \\(n\\) become large and \\(p\\) is not extremely small (close to 0) or extremely large (close to 1) the normal approximation is most useful in calculating binomial sums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal Approximation to the Binomial Distribution\n\n\n\n\nLet X be a binomial random variable with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(p\\). For large \\(n\\), \\(X\\) has approximately a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = np\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 =np(1-p)\\).\nThe approximation will be good if \\(np\\) and \\(n(1-p)\\) are greater than or equal to \\(5\\) (Walpole et al. 2017).\n\n\n\nContinuity correction\nThis correction is needed when we approximate a discrete distribution (Binomial in this case) by a continuous distribution (Normal). Recall that the probability \\(P(X = x)\\) may be positive if \\(X\\) is discrete, whereas it is always \\(0\\) for continuous \\(X\\). This is resolved by introducing a continuity correction. Expand the interval by 0.5 units in each direction, then use the Normal approximation (Baron 2019).\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Continuity correction for binomial probabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nBinomial Probability\nWith continuity correction\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(X=x)\\)\n\\(P(x-0.5&lt;X&lt;x+0.5)\\)\n\n\n\\(P(X\\le x)\\)\n\\(P(X\\le x+0.5)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.15 (Walpole et al. 2017, 191): The probability that a patient recovers from a rare blood disease is 0.4. If 100 people are known to have contracted this disease, what is the probability that fewer than 30 survive?",

    "text": "6.3 Exponential r.v\nIn many situations, such as when modeling waiting times, inter-arrival times, the lifespan of hardware, breakdown times, and the intervals between phone calls, the exponential distribution is utilized. The time (suppose \\(T\\)) between rare events in Poisson process with arrival rate \\(\\lambda\\) (number of arrival per unit time) can be treated as exponential r.v.\nThe exponential r.v \\(T\\) has the following PDF\n\\[\nf(t)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda t} \\ \\ ; \\ \\ t&gt;0\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\n\nCDF: \\(F(t)=P(T\\le t)=P(T&lt; t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}; t&gt; 0\\)\nHence, \\(P(T&gt; t)=1-P(T\\le t)=1-F(t)=e^{-\\lambda t}\\)\nMean: \\(E(T)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\)\nVariance: \\(Var(T)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\)\nWe write, \\(T\\sim Exp(\\lambda)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Exponential probability density functions for selected values of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quantity \\(\\lambda\\) is a parameter of Exponential distribution, and its meaning is clear from \\(E(T) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) . If T is time, measured in minutes, then \\(\\lambda\\) is a frequency, measured in \\(min^{-1}\\). For example, if arrivals occur every half a minute, on the average, then \\(E(T) = 0.5\\)min and \\(\\lambda=2\\), saying that they occur with a frequency (arrival rate) of 2 arrivals per minute. This \\(\\lambda\\) has the same meaning as the parameter of Poisson distribution(Baron 2019).\nExample 4.5(Baron 2019) Jobs are sent to a printer at an average rate of 3 jobs per hour.\n\nWhat is the expected time between jobs?\nWhat is the probability that the next job is sent within 5 minutes?\n\nSolution: Given, number of jobs per hour, \\(\\lambda=3\\ \\ hr^{-1}\\) per hour. Let, \\(T\\)=time elapsed between jobs (hour).\nSo, \\(T\\sim Exp(\\lambda)\\)\n\n\\(E(T)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda} hr=\\frac{1}{3} hr=20\\ \\ mins\\);\nHere, \\(5 \\ \\ mins=\\frac{5}{60} hr=\\frac{1}{12} hr\\) We know, \\(F(t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}; t&gt;0\\)\n\nSo, \\(P(T&lt;5 \\ \\ mins)=P(T&lt;\\frac{1}{12})=F(\\frac{1}{12})=1-e^{-3*\\frac{1}{12}}=0.22\\)\nExample 4.58 (Navidi 2011) A radioactive mass emits particles according to a Poisson process at a mean rate of 15 particles per minute. At some point, a clock is started. What is the probability that more than 5 seconds will elapse before the next emission? What is the mean waiting time until the next particle is emitted?\nSolution\nLet, \\(T=elapsed \\ \\ time \\ \\ before \\ \\ the \\ \\ next \\ \\ emission (in \\ \\ second)\\)\nGiven, \\(\\lambda=15 min^{-1}=\\frac{15}{60} s^{-1}=0.25 s^{-1}\\) and\n\\(T\\sim Exp(\\lambda)\\);\n\\(P(T\\le t)=F(t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}\\)\nP(more than 5 seconds will elapse before the next emission)=\\(P(T&gt;5)=e^{-\\lambda * 5}=e^{-0.25*5}=0.2865\\)\nMean waiting time, \\(E(T)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda} s=\\frac{1}{0.25}s=4s\\)\n\n6.3.1 Lack of Memory Property\nIf \\(T \\sim Exp(\\lambda)\\), and \\(t\\) and \\(s\\) are positive numbers, then\n\\[\nP(T&gt; t+s| T&gt; s)=P(T&gt; t)\n\\]\nWe can also express the Lack of memory property in this way:\n\\[\nP(T&lt; t+s| T&gt; s)=P(T&lt; t)\n\\]\nThe probability that we must wait additional \\(t\\) units, given that we have already waited \\(s\\) units, is the same as the probability that we must wait \\(t\\) units from the start. The exponential distribution does not “remember” how long we have been waiting.\n\nIn particular, if the lifetime of a component follows the exponential distribution, then the probability that a component that is \\(s\\) time units old will last an additional \\(t\\) time units is the same as the probability that a new component will last \\(t\\) time units.\nIn other words, a component whose lifetime follows an exponential distribution does not show any effects of age or wear(Navidi 2011).\nBut if the failure of the component is a result of gradual or slow wear (as in mechanical wear), then the exponential does not apply and either the gamma or the Weibull distribution (see (Walpole et al. 2017), Section 6.10) may be more appropriate.\n\nExample 4.59(Navidi 2011) The lifetime of a particular integrated circuit has an exponential distribution with mean 2 years. Find the probability that the circuit lasts longer than three years.\nExample 4.60(Navidi 2011) Refer to Example 4.59. Assume the circuit is now four years old and is still functioning. Find the probability that it functions for more than three additional years (Hints: Apply Lack of Memory Property).\nExercises for Section 4.7(Navidi 2011)\n1.Let \\(T \\sim Exp(0.45)\\). Find \\(\\mu_T, \\sigma^2_T, P(T&gt;3)\\) and the median of \\(T\\).\n2.The time between requests to a web server is exponentially distributed with mean 0.5 seconds.\n\nWhat is the value of the parameter \\(\\lambda\\)?\nWhat is the median time between requests?\nWhat is the standard deviation?\nWhat is the 80th percentile?\nFind the probability that more than one second elapses between requests.\nIf there have been no requests for the past two seconds, what is the probability that there more than one additional second will elapse before the next request?\n\nSolution\nLet, \\(T=time \\ \\ between \\ \\ requests \\ \\ in \\ \\ second\\)\nIf, \\(T\\sim Exp(\\lambda)\\); then it is given that\n\\(E(T)=0.5 \\ \\ second\\)\n\\(\\implies \\frac{1}{\\lambda}=0.5 \\ \\ second\\)\na. \\(\\therefore \\lambda=2 s^{-1}\\)\nb. If \\(M\\) is the median time between request then,\n\\(P(T \\le M)=0.5\\)\n\\(\\implies F(M)=0.5\\)\n\\(\\implies 1-e^{-\\lambda *M}=0.5\\)\n\\(\\implies e^{-\\lambda *M}=0.5\\)\n\\(\\implies {-\\lambda *M}=ln(0.5)\\)\n\\(\\implies M =\\frac{ln(0.5)}{-\\lambda}=\\frac{ln(0.5)}{-2}=0.3466\\approx0.35\\)\nSo, median time between request is \\(0.35s\\)\nc. Standard deviation of \\(T\\), \\(\\sigma_T=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}s=1/2 =0.5 s\\)\nd. Let, \\(P_{80}\\) denotes 80th percentile.\nSo, solve the following equation for \\(P_{80}\\)\n\\(P(T\\le P_{80})=0.80\\)\n\\(\\implies P(T&gt;P_{80})=0.20\\)\n\\(\\implies e^{-\\lambda \\times P_{80}}=0.20\\)\n\\(\\implies P_{80}=\\frac {ln(0.20)}{-\\lambda}=0.805\\)\n\\(\\therefore P_{80}=0.805 s\\)\ne. \\(P(T&gt;1)=e^{-\\lambda *1}=0.1353\\)\nf. If there have been no requests for the past two seconds, the probability that there more than one additional second will elapse before the next request is:\n\\(P(T&gt;1+2 /T&gt;2)=P(T&gt;1)=e^{-\\lambda *1}=0.1353\\) [by using Lack of memory property]\n8.A radioactive mass emits particles according to a Poisson process at a mean rate of 2 per second. Let T be the waiting time, in seconds, between emissions.\n\nWhat is the mean waiting time?\nWhat is the median waiting time?\nFind \\(P(T &gt; 2)\\).

Hint:\\(P(0.3&lt; T &lt; 1.5)=F(1.5)-F(0.3)\\)\nIf 3 seconds have elapsed with no emission, what is the probability that there will be an emission within the next second? (Use Lack of Memory Property)\n\nSolution of f.\nSince T is exponentially distributed and hold lack of memory property, so it dose not matter what was happened in past 3 seconds. We have to just compute that there will be an emission (event will occur) within the next second. So,\n\\(P(T&lt;1)=F(1)=1-e^{-\\lambda*1}\\) (do yourself)\n\n\n6.3.2 Generating exponential random numbers in R\n\npar(mar=c(4,4,1,1)) # Adjust graph margin\nset.seed(911) \nt=rexp(1000,rate = 2.5)\nhist(t, main = \"\",col = \"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Histogram of exponential random variable from Exp(\\(\\lambda=2.5)\\),\\(\\ n=1000\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaron, Michael. 2019.
